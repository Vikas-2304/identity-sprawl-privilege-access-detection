# Identity Risk Console — Phase 2 & 3

Cross-platform identity risk dashboard. Backend (FastAPI + Pandas + NetworkX)
serves a deterministic risk-scoring engine; frontend (React + Vite + React Flow)
renders the risk register, the privilege graph, and remediation playbooks.

This covers **Phase 2 (API & Backend)** and **Phase 3 (Frontend & Dashboard)**
from the hackathon plan. Phase 1 (data generator / graph builder / risk engine
your teammates own) is stubbed with realistic mock data so you can build and
demo independently — see `backend/DATA_CONTRACT.md` for the handoff schema.

## Quick start

**Terminal 1 — backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python mock_data_generator.py   # only needed once, or after teammates' CSVs change
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 — frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The frontend talks to the backend at
`http://localhost:8000` (configurable via `frontend/.env`).

## What's in the dashboard

1. **Risk Register** (left pane) — sortable table of all identities, risk
   score shown as a radial dial, filterable by tier or "offboarding gaps only,"
   searchable by name/ID.
2. **Identity graph** (right pane, tab 1) — click any row to see that
   identity's full reachable privilege graph via React Flow. The path to any
   admin/role node it can reach is highlighted in red — this is the "hidden
   nested-group" reveal from the demo script.
3. **Remediation playbook** (right pane, tab 2) — concrete, copyable CLI
   commands generated from which risk rules fired for that identity.

## Project layout

```
backend/
  mock_data_generator.py   # Faker-based fake data, 4 risk cases injected
  graph_builder.py         # NetworkX privilege graph + nx.descendants()
  risk_engine.py            # deterministic Option-B scoring rules
  main.py                  # FastAPI app, 3 main endpoints + stats/refresh
  DATA_CONTRACT.md         # schema doc for Phase-1 teammates
  data/                    # generated CSVs land here

frontend/
  src/components/
    RiskRegister.jsx       # Page 1
    IdentityGraph.jsx      # Page 2 (React Flow + dagre auto-layout)
    RemediationPanel.jsx   # Page 3
    RiskDial.jsx           # signature radial score indicator
    ReasonBadge.jsx        # risk-reason chips
    Header.jsx             # stats bar
  src/lib/api.js           # fetch wrapper for all backend calls
```

## Demo flow that matches the strategy doc

1. Open the register, sorted by risk score — `cross_platform_blast_radius`
   and `offboarding_gap` cases sit at the top (score 95).
2. Click `svc-etl-prod` (a `no_hr_owner` service account, score 80).
3. Switch to the **Identity graph** tab — show the red-highlighted path
   from the service account through nested AWS groups to `GlobalAdmin`
   and `S3FullAccess`.
4. Switch to **Remediation** — show the generated command to pull it out
   of the privileged group.
5. Filter the register to "Offboarding gaps only" to show the 6 contractors
   whose access wasn't revoked after termination.

## Swapping in real Phase-1 data

Once your teammates' generator/risk-engine is ready:
1. Have them match the column names in `backend/DATA_CONTRACT.md`.
2. Drop their CSVs into `backend/data/`, overwriting the mock ones.
3. `POST http://localhost:8000/api/refresh` (or just restart uvicorn).

No frontend or backend code changes needed — the contract is the seam.
